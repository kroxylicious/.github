By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 
Any unacceptable behavior should be reported to [kroxylicious-admins@redhat.com](mailto:kroxylicious-admins@redhat.com).

## How can I contribute

You can contribute by:

* Reporting any issues you find using Kroxylicious
* Fixing issues by opening Pull Requests
* Reviewing Pull Requests opened by others.
* Improving documentation
* Talking about Kroxylicious

All bugs, tasks or enhancements are tracked as GitHub issues.
Issues which might be a good start for new contributors are marked with the “good-start” label.

## DCO Signoff

The project requires that all commits are signed-off, indicating that _you_ certify the changes with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO)](./DCO.txt).

This can be done using `git commit -s` for each commit
in your pull request. Alternatively, to signoff a bunch of commits you can use `git rebase --signoff _your-branch_`.

## Code Review

All changes which are to be committed in project source control must be reviewed by at least one Code Owner before being merged.
If the change is being authored by someone who is a Code Owner, that change must be reviewed by at least one other Code Owner before being merged.
