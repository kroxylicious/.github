# Contributing

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. 
Any unacceptable behavior should be reported to [kroxylicious-admins@redhat.com](mailto:kroxylicious-admins@redhat.com).

## How can I contribute

You can contribute by:

* Reporting any issues you find using Kroxylicious
* Fixing issues by opening Pull Requests
* Reviewing Pull Requests opened by others.
* Improving documentation
* Talking about Kroxylicious

All bugs, tasks or enhancements are tracked as GitHub issues.
Issues which might be a good start for new contributors are marked with the “good-start” label.

## DCO Signoff

The project requires that all commits are signed-off, indicating that _you_ certify the changes with the [Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO)](./DCO.txt).

This can be done using `git commit -s` for each commit
in your pull request. Alternatively, to signoff a bunch of commits you can use `git rebase --signoff _your-branch_`.

## PR Review

All changes which are to be committed in project source control must be reviewed by at least one [Committer](COMMITTERS.md) before being merged.
If the change is being authored by someone who is a Committer, that change must be reviewed by at least one other Committer before being merged.
The GitHub teams `@kroxylicious/code-reviewers` and `@kroxylicious/doc-reviewers` can be used to request a PR review from contributors.

If you're willing to provide code and/or reviews to others then let one of the [project managers](PMs.md) know know and we can add you to the relevant GitHub team.
