## Decision Making

This project follows The [Commonhaus decision making][cdm] process.
This project uses the following decision making process.

1. **Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus):** The project primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where code owners and active contributors discuss and come to an agreement.
2. **Voting:** In situations where consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be made through a simple majority vote among the code owners.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts arise, code owners are responsible for facilitating a resolution. The [Commonhaus Foundation Council][cfc] (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion, if necessary.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please ensure you are familiar with its guidelines and expectations, as it's essential for maintaining a positive and collaborative environment.

## Trademark Policy

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution, from code improvements to documentation and design. For details on how to contribute and the process your contributions will follow, please read our [Contributing Guidelines][contrib].

## Becoming a Code Owner
