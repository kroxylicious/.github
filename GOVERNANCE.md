# Purpose

The purpose of the Kroxylicious Project is to develop a Kafka protocol proxy with an open source license, and to make the resulting software and documentation available to Users.

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the project are expected to adhere to the project's [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please ensure you are familiar with its guidelines and expectations, as it's essential for maintaining a positive and collaborative environment.

## Participants

- **Users:** Anyone using the software is a User. 
    While the Project exists to provide the software to Users, the other participants' duties are to all current and potential Users collectively, any not to the interests of any one User, or subset of Users.

- **Contributors:** Anyone who contributes to the project in any form is a Contributor.
    Contributions can take a variety of forms, but many of them, such as source code and documentation, need to be approved before being accepted by the Project.
    The most common kind of contribution requiring such approval is a github pull request (PR); the merging of the PR signifies its approval.
    The duty of a Contributor is to offer a contribution in good faith, to the best of their ability, and being honest when signing off on the Developer Certificate of Origin.

- **Committers:** Individuals with write access to any repository within the Kroxylicious GitHub organisation, except for the repository containing this `GOVERNANCE.md` file.
    The duty of a Committer is to help Contributors make high quality contributions to the Project.
    As such Committers are responsible for reviewing and merging contributions. 
    An individual may act as both a Contributor and a Committer for a contribution.
    
- **Project Managers:** Individuals with write access to the repository containing this `GOVERNANCE.md` file within the Kroxylicious GitHub organisation.
    Project Managers are tasked with identifying individuals who have made valuable contributions which further the Project's purpose. 
    They can collectively decide to invite a Contributor to become a Committer; or to invite a Committer to become a Project Manager. 

## Contributing

We welcome all forms of contribution, from code improvements to documentation and design. For details on how to contribute and the process your contributions will follow, please read our [Contributing Guidelines][contrib].

## Decision Making

This project follows The [Commonhaus decision making][cdm] process.
This project uses the following decision making process.

1. **Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus):** The project primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where committers and active contributors discuss and come to an agreement.
2. **Voting:** In situations where consensus cannot be reached about a PR, decisions may be made through a simple majority vote among the committers.
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts arise, project managers are responsible for facilitating a resolution. The [Commonhaus Foundation Council][cfc] (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion, if necessary.

## Becoming a Committer

New Committers can be elected by a majority vote of the Project Managers following the [Decision Making](#decision-making) process.

To ensure that all potential Committers are judged fairly and consistently the following criteria should be taken into account in electing new Committers:

### Committer Criteria

* Sustained contributions over at least 3 months ideally including non-trivial PRs.
* Reviewing other contributors’ PRs
* Contributing to multiple aspects of the project and community. For example:
  * Bug reporting, triage and fixing
  * Addressing technical debt (in code, testing and documentation).
  * Documentation (both content and structure).
  * Helping users, for example on GitHub, the mailing list, Slack, Stack Overflow, and so on.
  * Promotion of Kroxylicious, for example by blogging, speaking at conferences, and so on.
* Knowing when to ask for help or seek consensus.
* An indication of being committed to the long term success of the project.
