## Decision Making

<!-- This project follows The [Commonhaus decision making][cdm] process.-->
This project uses the following decision making process.

1. **Consensus-seeking (lazy consensus):** The project primarily aims for a consensus-based decision-making process, where code owners and active contributors discuss and come to an agreement.
2. **Voting:** In situations where consensus cannot be reached, decisions may be made through a simple majority vote among the code owners.
<!--
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If conflicts arise, code owners are responsible for facilitating a resolution. The [Commonhaus Foundation Council][cfc] (CFC) can be asked to mediate the discussion, if necessary.
