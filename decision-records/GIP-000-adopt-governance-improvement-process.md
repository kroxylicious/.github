## 1. Context

There are deficiencies in our current process to change our internal Governance model (within our remit as part of the Commonhaus Foundation).

1. There is no defined way for Contributors to propose governance changes. It would be informal, maybe captured in a Pull Request into this repository, maybe on slack.
2. There is no defined way to record the reasons for changes. It might be captured in a PR, or a commit message, but it will be scattered.

These issues add up to an intransparent process that is not friendly to new Contributors. They don't know how their rights and responsibilities might change under their feet or how to join in.

While a relatively informal approach may suit our needs in the technical areas of the Project, the Governance aspects feel like they should be more rigourous as they touch on responsibilities to our
Foundation, sharing of powerful credentials which represent a security risk to the world, and making our neutrality transparent. So I feel some light process is justified.

## 2. Proposed Changes

All changes to Kroxylicious Governance must be made through a **Government Improvement Process** (GIP). Using this process any Contributor can create a Proposal for an improvement to our Governance.

A Proposal will have an identifier, like `GIP-000`. A proposal will be created by making a Pull Request (PR) into this repository. The PR will contain changes to the relevant Governance files and
a Governance Decision Record (GDR) file which provides context and an administrative record of the decision if the Proposal is accepted.

We will use our existing decision making process, recording objections and approvals using comments on the PR. If it is accepted, a Code Owner will update the administrative details in the GDR
file, approve and merge the PR. At that point it will become part of our Governance model.

## 3. Rationale

1. The community can learn how to participate in Governance
2. There will be clarity for organization members on how their rights/responsibilities are determined
3. We will leave a useful history, providing details of what changed and evidence that we followed our process

## 4. Rejected Alternatives
